What we should test?
- Testing component rendering
- UI elements that we write
- Functions which we write
- API Testing
- Event Testing
- Props and states
- UI condition testing | UI state testing

Avoid testing for
- External UI library code
- No need ti test default function of JS and react
- Sometime we should mock function rather than testing it in details.

Important points
- Do not write snapshots in starting of the project
- Run test case after completing your functionality
- Make a standard for code coverage
